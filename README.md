# Kata TDD Median

The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution).

For a data set, it may be thought of as the "middle" value.

For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. in the data set {6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 3}, the median is 6.5 begin the average of the 2 "middle" values 6 and 7.

The purpose of this exercise is to implement the algorithm that computes the median for an integer array and the associated unit tests.

Feel free to modify everything (assembly names and structure, class names, method names, code organization, etc.) so that we get a feeling on how you code
